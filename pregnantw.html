    <p><strong>Malnutrition and infections are the main health problems affecting the health of the mother and these can be prevented by effective utilization of ICDS services.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Primary care physicians and his team play a key role in promoting the package of services delivered under ICDS and works in coordination with anganwadi centers.</em></p>
    <p>Primary care physicians should be aware of barriers for utilization of anganwadi services among the beneficiaries in the community in order to plan appropriate sensitization activities for motivating them to avail the services in view of reducing maternal morbidity and mortality and by projecting utilization rates and barriers the current study will come in handy to plan the activities for promoting ICDS.</p>
    <p>Although the majority of the pregnant women were utilizing anganwadi services except for health education and referral services, there is a need to sensitize and motivate beneficiaries in order to improve the utilization rates of services delivered by anganwadi center. Distance from anganwadi center was significantly associated with utilization of services. The health care team should motivate and encourage pregnant women who were residing far away from anganwadi center or develop alternate strategies for them to utilize the services, which are meant to improve their nutritional and health status thus resulting in positive pregnancy outcomes.</p>
